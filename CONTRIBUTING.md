To work, the project will need API keys from [New York Times Bestseller API][3] and [Google Books API][4]. Create a file called "keys.xml" in the \res\values folder with these values:-

	<string name="nyt_bestseller_key">YOUR_NYTB_KEY_HERE</string>
    <string name="google_books_key">YOUR_GOOGLE_BOOKS_KEY_HERE</string>


## Siging Release Builds

You will have to add your keystore file with the name "keystore.jks" in the app folder. Create a "keystore.properties" file in the the project's root folder with these values:-

	storeFile=keystore.jks
	keyAlias=YOUR_KEY_ALIAS_HERE
	storePassword=YOUR_STORE_PASS_HERE
	keyPassword=YOUR_KEY_PASS_HERE
